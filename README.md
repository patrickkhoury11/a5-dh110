# Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

Low-fidelity prototypes are helpful in enabling early visualization of alternative design solutions, which helps provoke innovation and improvement. Low-fidelity prototypes translate high-level design concepts into testable artifacts, and are especially useful in the early stages in the design process. Low-fidelity testing is always beneficial in the design process, as it is inexpensive, fast, collaborative, and clarifying. Improvements to these prototypes can be made very easily, and users often feel most comfortable suggesting changes during this time, as the product is not yet finished and development hasn’t been completed. Creators can easily iterate the product in real time, as parts of the design can be quickly redone in a few minutes based on consumer comments. The following wireframes will serve as the initial prototype of my product. Through user interactions, it will allow me to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application that I am designing and give me insightful feedback on how to optimize this process.

## Wireframes
The following wireframes (pdf version linked [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199420376-5efaf300-243d-408d-8975-b2fc1b30b94e.png) serve as the foundation of the application. The five wireframes below represent the five main naviagtion tabs within the application. These wireframes are the hub of all naviagtion and task completion within the app.

*From left to right:*
* Home page: This is the page where all posts from accounts the user follows will appear. Furthermore, environmental facts will appear on this page. The user may search for accounts, direct message other users, turn on/off post notifications, and create posts from  this page.
* Shop: This is where the user can buy or sell second-hand or refurbished items. The user can search for or save any particular items they like. They may also leave reviews for items they have bought.
* Rides: This is where the user can carpool or commute group to a destination. Carpooling is used to get from Point A to Point B whenever the user needs. Commute groups are used for recurring rides to work, school, or wherever else the user's commute might take them. 
* Events: This is where the user can create or sign up for environmental events. Users are able to save events, invite their friends, or get any additional information they may need in this page. There is also a search and filter feature available.
* Profile: This is where the user can view or edit how their profile looks to others utilizing the app. Users' profile picture, bio, link, posts, etc are all present in this page. 

## Persona-based Tasks
I created two personas in the previous assignment based on my findings from my interviews and analysis. The story of each persona from the previous step will be presented below. I will also create key scenarios which illustrate a different activity/task to accomplish a feature inspired by the users’ personas. 

Persona 1: Alex’s Story - the new kid
* Alex is an outgoing 19 year old who moved from gloomy Louisiana to sunny San Diego for school. Alex instantly fell in love with Southern California culture and developed a love for surfing in his first year at UCSD, but can’t go as much as he would like to because he does not have a car and Uber is too expensive for daily travel. Alex wasn’t great friends with his old roommates, but looks up to his new one, Noah, who is from Carlsbad and seems to fit right into life in San Diego. In an attempt to be more like Noah, Alex buys cheap clothing and accessories from Shein. When the package arrives, Alex shows Noah, however he does not get the reaction he was anticipating. Noah berrates Alex for buying from Shein, as they have a history of awful working conditions and participates in fast fashion, contributing waste to landfills and harming the environment. Alex had no knowledge of this, as sustainability practice is not popular in Louisiana. This leaves Alex confused and disappointed. Alex is determined to fit into his desired lifestyle at UCSD, but does not have large sums of spending money or the knowledge about sustainability practices to achieve his goal.

Task 1:
* Alex needs a cheap desk for his apartment after living life in the dorms his freshman year. Alex would like his desk to be second-hand, as his roommate Noah is passionate about sustainable living. Alex does not own a car, so he would like the desk to be in a 5 mile radius from UCSD.

Persona 2: Chloe’s Story - the work-a-holic
* Chloe is a social butterfly who loves to interact in groups. She recently moved to Union City, NJ for work from Laguna Beach, CA and has yet to make significant friends. Chloe’s job functions as a hybrid system, with her only needing to come into work once every week. Despite this, her job is extremely demanding, requiring her to work long hours to complete projects. Chloe, being from a beach town in California, is extremely passionate about the environment and its well-being, but realizes her typically sustainable living style has shifted due to her demanding work schedule and new environment. Furthermore, Chloe misses her friends from home and spends whatever free time she has scrolling on social media, reminiscing about her old life in Laguna Beach. After her fourth consecutive week of the same routine which leaves Chloe feeling depressed and unfulfilled, Chloe decides to talk to a coworker next in-person work day in hopes of making a change.

Task 2:
* Chloe recently won the election to become the Vice President of the Ocean Resources for Conservation and Advocacy (ORCA) organization. They are holding their first meeting this upcoming Friday. Chloe would like to change her bio in the application to show off her new title and publish the sign-up link to her profile so her followers can sign up to come to the first official meeting.

Thus, the low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Shop for a second-hand desk within a 5 mile radius
2. Change the bio and link on the profile page

## Wireframes and Wireflow

### Initial Wireframe applied in Wireflow 1, Task 1

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to navigate to the shop screen from the home page. Next, the user would have to hit the "Search for anything" button. The user would then search the term "Used desk". After getting to the results page, the user would filter their results by hitting the "Filter" button. They would hit the "Distance" button on the filter menu. Next the user would slide the distance bar to up to 5 miles. The user would then select the "View Items" button. After that, the user would select the item and hit the "Add to Bag" button.


### Initial Wireframe applied in Wireflow 2, Task 2
![wf2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199509274-348054b9-da0d-497d-a2f3-badc3dc66fbc.png)

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to navigate to the profile screen from the home page. Next, the user would have to hit the "Edit Profile" button. The user would then hit the "Bio" section and select on the existing text. The user would replace this text with the desired text and hit done. After returning to the "Edit Profile" page, the user then hit the "Links" section. The user would then hit the "Add External Link" button and replace the existing link with the desired link and title. Finally, the user would hit the "Done" button and return to their updated profile page.


## Prototype Testing 

### Task 1

Test User Wireflow 1, Task 1:

*Valuable Feedback from the user:* 
"I think it would be more clear if the ends of the bar were labeled "Min" and "Max" or something along those lines. Might also be helpful to have preset mile notches in the bar (like 5, 25, 50, 100 miles) because I don't know how "up to 5 miles" pops up." 

"When following the recommendation tool, the user was hesitant to filter and sort by ratings. The feature was intended for the user to select specific ratings, for example, only ratings with a 4/5 and 5/5 rating. With this understanding, the user decided not to sort by rating because she wanted to look at all ratings, regardless of how they scored the hotel. After testing, the user asked me if this was the correct interpretation. Additionally, after pressing **Done**, the user expected to return to the list of reviews. The flow instead returned to the information about the hotel. This was an error on my part in how I designed the flow."

### Task 2

Initial Wireframes applied in Wireflow 2, Task 2

*Valuable Feedback from the user:* 
"Got stuck here because there is no "apply" button on the different filters. Displaying the item count in the bottom button is helpful to a certain extent, but without an *apply" button I'm not sure how I would have added multiple filters at once. The only options are to view the newly-filtered item list or to hit the back arrow which I'm guessing would just take me back to the general filter page. Maybe would be better to replace the "reset" button with apply" and move "reset" down towards the bottom of the page?"
 
"My instinct is to use the search bar here but there's no real indication of how to submit / enter the search and Bas get to the next page - would type and hit' "enter" on mv phone keyboard, would there be a dropdown with auto /suggestions, would I have to select the icon within the search bar to submit? Just unclear how this would work."  

"None of the profile information labels are underlined / in a button / otherwise guide me to know if I'm supposed to click into the labels to edit, or if the edit function comes up if I click into the text."  

"Was confused with "done" button and what next frame would potentially be, didn't know if it would just go back to main profile page or save the edits and go back to edit profile page. Would be more clear if it said "save changes" or something"

"Here, "done" button took me back to the main profile page, not the edit profile page like it did before, which is confusing / inconsistent. Think the "done" button can stay "Done” on the edit profile page as an indicator that you are done with all edits and should take you back to the main profile page, and the individual edit pages should have a "save changes" button that takes you back to the edit profile page."

## Reflection:

I had never interacted with a low-fidelity prototype before this assignment and ended up gaining some really important insights both from developing the prototype itself and from the testing process. I decided to dedicate extra time to building out the wireframes for all 5 of the base tabs on my application (Home, Shop, Ride, Events, and Profile) in order to get a better understanding of what elements were necessary for the application to have the functionality that I hoped to piece together from previous assignments. I first started with hand-drawn sketches and made a few iterations of what I wanted to include on each page. Then, once I was able to narrow down and be more certain about specific inclusions, I moved to construct the broader wireframes on figma digital program. Next, I decided on the application features I most wanted to test and corresponding user scenarios / tasks that utilized those features. I continued on to design user task wireflows and invited a friend of mine to test the prototype. The testing process itself went pretty smoothly, as the tester was able to complete all of the tasks and provided some great feedback. I actually did not expect the process to translate so well onto paper, but we were able to get through the prototype test with no issues.

I ended up revising my wireframes quite a bit throughout the building process, as I realized that I was suffering from tunnel vision. I had unintentionally reflected my perspective (which has been focused on this project all quarter) onto the organization of the application, which resulted in wireframes that I understood completely, but could be perceived as too in the weeds to be understood by third-party users. Instead of moving forward with those wireframes, I learned to take a step back to evaluate how a regular user would interpret and interact with the presentation, and step outside my perspective to put together a prototype I hoped would lead to a seamless, logical experience for my test user. I think this is an area of potential growth for me. Next time, I will more immediately think through what is informing my wireframe organization decisions, and if a user without an extended background in my application subject would find it clear.

Unfortunately, there were still a few things that I missed, and ended up being flagged by my tester as confusing. Namely, I need to revise the labeling of interactive elements in my prototype -- there were a few elements that were either labeled in a way that was misleading or that were not clearly labeled (or indicated otherwise) to be interactive. For example, my tester pointed out that “Done” and “Save Changes” buttons, though very similar at the surface, could actually mean different things in terms of application navigation. Where “Save Changes” would explicitly note that the user’s edits are being saved, “Done” does not -- and also does not give the user any indication of where they would be directed to after clicking “Done.” I would address this problem via a prototype revision where I am able to be more clear about labeling, and only use “Done” as a final close-out button (for example, when users have already saved edits and want to navigate away from that page) and use “Save Changes” as a button to process and save user edits. I would also be able to make sure that all interactive elements are reflected as such on the application by underlining them -- even though the nature of the prototype test meant that the user could not benefit from instant feedback on the screen, it is still important to be consistent in communicating which elements of the application are interactive.
