# Assignment 05: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Patrick Khoury | DH110 | Dr. Sookie Cho

## Project Description

This project will promote efficiency and convenience for user sustainability efforts by consolidating a variety of environmentally-conscious activities and services into one mobile application, presented as a social media platform. The aforementioned activities and services would be geared towards target users’ needs and daily lifestyle; for example, including carpooling, thrifting/clothing swaps, furniture repurposing, sustainability events, etc. In this way, my project will mainly support users in gaining an environmentally-conscious community and lowering barriers to access for information about related activities and services.

Low-fidelity prototypes are helpful in enabling early visualization of alternative design solutions, which helps provoke innovation and improvement. Low-fidelity prototypes translate high-level design concepts into testable artifacts, and are especially useful in the early stages in the design process. Low-fidelity testing is always beneficial in the design process, as it is inexpensive, fast, collaborative, and clarifying. Improvements to these prototypes can be made very easily, and users often feel most comfortable suggesting changes during this time, as the product is not yet finished and development hasn’t been completed. Creators can easily iterate the product in real time, as parts of the design can be quickly redone in a few minutes based on consumer comments. The following wireframes will serve as the initial prototype of my product. Through user interactions, it will allow me to begin working through how exactly the user will interact with the application that I am designing and give me insightful feedback on how to optimize this process.

## Wireframes
The following wireframes (pdf version linked [here]![oooop (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114698093/199501783-1657bdaf-bb2c-4e26-aa83-2ba1c579c60d.png) serve as the foundation of the application. The five wireframes below represent the five main naviagtion tabs within the application. These wireframes are the hub of all naviagtion and task completion within the app.

*From left to right:*
* Home page: This is the page where all posts from accounts the user follows will appear. Furthermore, environmental facts will appear on this page. The user may search for accounts, direct message other users, turn on/off post notifications, and create posts from  this page.
* Shop: This is where the user can buy or sell second-hand or refurbished items. The user can search for or save any particular items they like. They may also leave reviews for items they have bought.
* Rides: This is where the user can carpool or commute group to a destination. Carpooling is used to get from Point A to Point B whenever the user needs. Commute groups are used for recurring rides to work, school, or wherever else the user's commute might take them. 
* Events: This is where the user can create or sign up for environmental events. Users are able to save events, invite their friends, or get any additional information they may need in this page. There is also a search and filter feature available.
* Profile: This is where the user can view or edit how their profile looks to others utilizing the app. Users' profile picture, bio, link, posts, etc are all present in this page. 

## Persona-based Tasks
I created two personas in the previous assignment based on my findings from my interviews and analysis. The story of each persona from the previous step will be presented below. I will also create key scenarios which illustrate a different activity/task to accomplish a feature inspired by the users’ personas. 

Persona 1: Alex’s Story - the new kid
* Alex is an outgoing 19 year old who moved from gloomy Louisiana to sunny San Diego for school. Alex instantly fell in love with Southern California culture and developed a love for surfing in his first year at UCSD, but can’t go as much as he would like to because he does not have a car and Uber is too expensive for daily travel. Alex wasn’t great friends with his old roommates, but looks up to his new one, Noah, who is from Carlsbad and seems to fit right into life in San Diego. In an attempt to be more like Noah, Alex buys cheap clothing and accessories from Shein. When the package arrives, Alex shows Noah, however he does not get the reaction he was anticipating. Noah berrates Alex for buying from Shein, as they have a history of awful working conditions and participates in fast fashion, contributing waste to landfills and harming the environment. Alex had no knowledge of this, as sustainability practice is not popular in Louisiana. This leaves Alex confused and disappointed. Alex is determined to fit into his desired lifestyle at UCSD, but does not have large sums of spending money or the knowledge about sustainability practices to achieve his goal.

Task 1:
* Alex needs a cheap desk for his apartment after living life in the dorms his freshman year. Alex would like his desk to be second-hand, as his roommate Noah is passionate about sustainable living. Alex does not own a car, so he would like the desk to be in a 5 mile radius from UCSD.

Persona 2: Chloe’s Story - the work-a-holic
* Chloe is a social butterfly who loves to interact in groups. She recently moved to Union City, NJ for work from Laguna Beach, CA and has yet to make significant friends. Chloe’s job functions as a hybrid system, with her only needing to come into work once every week. Despite this, her job is extremely demanding, requiring her to work long hours to complete projects. Chloe, being from a beach town in California, is extremely passionate about the environment and its well-being, but realizes her typically sustainable living style has shifted due to her demanding work schedule and new environment. Furthermore, Chloe misses her friends from home and spends whatever free time she has scrolling on social media, reminiscing about her old life in Laguna Beach. After her fourth consecutive week of the same routine which leaves Chloe feeling depressed and unfulfilled, Chloe decides to talk to a coworker next in-person work day in hopes of making a change.

Task 2:
* Chloe recently won the election to become the Vice President of the Ocean Resources for Conservation and Advocacy (ORCA) organization. They are holding their first meeting this upcoming Friday. Chloe would like to change her bio in the application to show off her new title and publish the sign-up link to her profile so her followers can sign up to come to the first official meeting.

Thus, the low-fidelity prototype supports the following tasks:
1. Shop for a second-hand desk within a 5 mile radius
2. Change the bio and link on the profile page

## Wireframes and Wireflow
![Wireflow Stage 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74673232-b0520980-5163-11ea-8b9e-a3696b4758b9.jpg)

*Flow Description:* The flow intends for the user to search for their bundle trip based on their departure and arrival city or airport, dates of travel, number of travelers, and travel budget (optional). Based on the hotel results, a user can sort or filter the list by hotel name, star rating, and amenities. After clicking on a hotel, a user can view and sort ratings based on their search query and trip purpose. After selecting the room, a user will select an inbound and outbound flight to and from their travel destination. Again, based on their search results, a user has the option to sort or filter flights by duration, stops, time, and airline. After selecting both flights, the user will be directed to a trip summary of their hotel and flight selections. The user has the option to change their selections. If they are satisfied with their selections, the user can proceed to pay for their flight. They will input their passenger and payment details and have the option to insure their trip. Clicking on "Complete Booking" signifies the completion of the travel booking process.  

*Features Description:* The price tool feature takes the user's input from their **travel budget**. If the user clicks on the **Price Tool** button, they will be directed to a new page where they have the option to change their search field to view more cost-efficient price options. For example, changing their departure airport to BUR from LAX. Cheaper flights will help lower the overall cost per person. The minimized flight booking process is reflected in a combined flight view. A user is able to select their inbound and outbound flight on the same screen, minimizing scrolling time and directing the user straight to booking. Flights are displayed by **Recommended** as default. The most important flight details are displayed, such as time, airline, flight duration, and price. If the user would like to see more flight details on the airline's website, they can click "See More". The recommendation tool feature is reflected in the hotel search results, displaying the highest recommended hotels on the top of the page. When viewing hotel reviews, the main points of the hotel's average rating are displayed at the top of the screen, such as **Cleanliness, Service, Comfort, Condition, and Location**. If the user clicks **Sort**, they have the option to customize the reviews based on the time of year, traveler type, and keyword in addition to rating and date. 

## Prototype Testing

### Iteration #1

![Wireflow S2 P1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74702985-a4e0fb80-51c0-11ea-9c99-d1fab76efa22.jpg)
![Wireflow S2 P2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74702992-a9a5af80-51c0-11ea-82de-e6b52c140240.jpg)

*Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:* 
The user surprisingly overlooked the dropdown menu frame when mentally going through the search input for flight departure and arrival airport. This makes sense due to the nature of the paper prototype where the airport is already inputted. The user was aware of the city and airport code. This would be interesting to see how helpful the dropdown menu would be for a user who is unaware of their travel destination and surrounding airports. More specifically, which airport do they need to fly into if necessary.

The user was confused about the frame where you can further sort through reviews. Because they did not need to sort further through reviews, there was no need to utilize the tool and feature. When asked what they thought the objective of the process was, they correctly assumed that the feature would help narrow down previous reviews of the hotel. In order to properly test these features, I asked the user to complete the iteration of the wireflow again with the intention of utilizing these features given what they are *supposed to do*. 

### Iteration #2

![Wireflow S3 P1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74703005-b88c6200-51c0-11ea-99d6-485576559db6.jpg)
![Wireflow S3 P2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59623155/74703008-baeebc00-51c0-11ea-96e8-d882540370ef.jpg)

*Confusions and/or unexpected interactions:* 
The user again did not follow the flow to the dropdown menu when inputting the departure and arrival airport. The user was correctly able to navigate the price tool to the page and interpreted that if they changed their departure airport from LAX to BUR, they could lower the price of their trip. Despite this understanding, the user decided to ignore the suggestion and go back to the original results. 

When following the recommendation tool, the user was hesitant to filter and sort by ratings. The feature was intended for the user to select specific ratings, for example, only ratings with a 4/5 and 5/5 rating. With this understanding, the user decided not to sort by rating because she wanted to look at all ratings, regardless of how they scored the hotel. After testing, the user asked me if this was the correct interpretation. Additionally, after pressing **Done**, the user expected to return to the list of reviews. The flow instead returned to the information about the hotel. This was an error on my part in how I designed the flow.  

## Reflection 
I believe the prototype testing went relatively smoothly; the user was successfully able to utilize all intended features despite a few minor setbacks. I did not account for the possibility that a user will not need to utilize the price tool and recommendation tool on every interaction. We conducted another walkthrough of the tasks to test these features which were easy and simple for the tester to use given the change in prototype state and system's intended response. I was surprised that the layout and organization of my wireframes were intuitive enough for a first-time user. I believe how often a user travels and uses such websites and/or apps does have a little influence on how well they can understand specific terms, such as inbound and outbound. My user travels a couple of times a year, both domestically and internationally, and readily uses Expedia as her main travel booking site. I decided to follow Expedia's layout and aesthetics when creating my wireframes.

The tester was confused that the review sort and filter returned to the hotel page when she pressed **Done**. I plan to correct my error and direct the flow back to the list of sorted reviews. The tester was hesitant and unsure whether they had to select a specific rating to sort through the results. I believe this can be solved through design and color when creating my digital prototype. I plan to make these options checkable through checkboxes which are optional in most design aesthetics. In addition to these changes, while this was not mentioned during user testing, I would draw out the flow for the **See More** button under flights. I believe it would be easier and more efficient for the user to view these details, if necessary, without leaving the app. I also believe it would be convenient for the user to have the **Reset** button on the hotel and flight *Sort* features.
